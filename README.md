Ever since I was little, I have enjoyed solving puzzles and helping others. My teachers would often tell my parents how I had a certain knack for not only for learning on my own, but elevating those around me to greater potentials. This, along with a love of music, led to a career as a music teacher. I always found great satisfaction in analyzing all the nuances of a band - the instruments, the notes on the page, the abilities of the players - and bringing them together for a final performance. 

Now I'm embarking on a new journey. On this journey I hope to reignite that childhood wonder for creative puzzle solving and apply that to a new career field in technology. Check out what I am working on!
